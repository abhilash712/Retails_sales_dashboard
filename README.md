Retail Sales Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel. I took a raw, messy dataset of retail store sales and transformed it into a clean, professional, and interactive dashboard to provide key business insights.

The final dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the company's performance and allows users to filter the data interactively.

Data Source

The Business Problem
The goal of this project was to analyze historical sales data to answer key business questions, such as:

What are the total sales and total number of transactions?

What are the top-selling items and categories?

How can we present this information clearly to a manager?

Key Steps and Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The raw data contained several issues that needed to be resolved before analysis.

Missing Values: I identified and removed 1,213 incomplete transactions with no associated sales data.

Data Type Conversion: I converted the Transaction Date column from a text format to a proper date format to enable time-based analysis.

Data Standardisation: I converted the Discount Applied column from boolean values (True/False) into numerical values (1/0) for calculations.

Data Extraction: I used a formula to extract the product name from the unique item codes, allowing for a clean and simple product analysis.

Data Analysis: I used PivotTables to quickly and accurately summarize the cleaned data to find key metrics.

Calculated Total Sales and Total Transactions.

Found the top-selling items by count.

Identified the top-selling categories by count.

Dashboard Creation: I designed a professional, single-sheet dashboard for clear data presentation.

Created Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to show total sales and total transactions at the top of the dashboard.

Added a clean, formatted column chart to visualize the best-selling items.

Added interactive slicers for Category and Location to allow a user to filter all dashboard visuals with a single click.

Key Findings
Based on the analysis, I found the following insights:

[Insert your actual findings here, e.g., "The total sales were ₹... with ... total transactions."]

[Insert the top-selling items here, e.g., "The top-selling items were..."]

[Insert the top-selling categories here, e.g., "The top-selling category was..."]

Future Scope
This project can be expanded to provide even deeper insights. Potential next steps include:

Customer Analysis: Analyze customer behavior to identify our most valuable customers and their purchasing habits.

Geographical Analysis: Create a map to visualize sales performance by location (e.g., online vs. in-store).

Time-Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or predict future sales.

Advanced Visualizations: Use different chart types, like a pie chart to show the percentage of sales per category or a line graph to visualize sales trends over time.
